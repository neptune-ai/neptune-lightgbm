# Neptune + LightGBM Integration

Experiment tracking, model registry, data versioning, and live model monitoring for LightGBM trained models.

## What will you get with this integration? 

* Log, display, organize, and compare ML experiments in a single place
* Version, store, manage, and query trained models, and model building metadata
* Record and monitor model training, evaluation, or production runs live

## What will be logged to Neptune?

* training and validation metrics,
* parameters,
* feature names, num_features, and num_rows for the train set,
* hardware consumption (CPU, GPU, memory),
* stdout and stderr logs,
